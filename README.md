to build the project:

- Install Cygwin, which gives us a Unix-like environment running on Windows.
- Install a set of Cygwin packages required for building GCC + Bison and Flex (use cygwin package manager when you run the setup)
- run make

to run it :

./turing.exe turing1.tur 1 2

(...) but as I studied turing machine some 10 years ago, can't recall the exact meaning of the output^^
